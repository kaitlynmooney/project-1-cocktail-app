# Sip, Sip, Hooray! : A cocktail-finding solution
https://github.com/kaitlynmooney/project-1-cocktail-app

## Description

This application was created for the 20-something who’s looking to graduate from their go-to Vodka Cran, but still doesn’t have the space, salary, and time needed to keep a fully-stocked bar.  

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use the app, you may click the 'Find a Cocktail' button and input ingredient(s) that you already have on hand. The page will dynamically generate up to 5 unique cocktail recipes using those ingredients. Click through the recipes using the 'Generate Another' button. To save one or move recipe for later, you may click the 'Add to Cocktail Library' button. The cocktail recipe will then be added below to the Cocktail Library carousel.
